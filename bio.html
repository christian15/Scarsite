Spanish Hip Hop artist and producer Scar also known as DJScar, is an Italian-Ecuadorian born and raised in Ecuador. At a young age, Scar showed an interest for music, learning both the piano and the guitar with ease. As years went by, his music teachers encouraged the development of his skills and classified him as an ear-player. His musical influences at this point in time where Spanish Rock giants: Soda Stereo, Los Enanitos Verdes, Duncan Dhu, Hombres G, Abuelos de la Nada, among others. He also enjoyed listening to music from: Linkin Park, System of a Down, Limp Bizkit, Nirvana, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Queen, and many others. Since he enjoyed playing by ear his parents opted not to put him in a conservatory.

As he looked to further his taste in music he started buying CDs of music he normally would not listen to.

The first CD Scar purchased was Curtain Close by Eminem, and it changed his life forever. At the age of fourteen he moved with his family to Naples Florida. Where his cousin re-introduced him to Hip-hop. In Naples, Scar went to Gulf Coast High School and truly focused his life around it and soccer. Music became a hobbie, something he did in his spare time.

Through Highschool Santiago caught a glimpse of what Hip-hop music was becoming internationally and shifted his music listening to fully understand modern Hip-hop. He learned a lot by listening to: Nach Scratch (SPA), Chojin (SPA), Racionais MC's (BRA), MVBill (BRA), Gabriel O Pensador (BRA), SFDK (SPA), Tres Coronas (NY/SA), Tote King (SPA), Guerrilla Seca (VEN), Shotta (SPA), Dogma Crew (SPA), Solo Los Solo (SPA), Tego Calderon (PR), and Violadores del Verso (SPA), among others as he understood the differences in musical culture that they each presented. He fully exploited his guitar work, during this time period as well, idolizing and emulating artists like: Seu Jorge, Alejandro Sanz, Djavan, Jobim, among others.

Graduated from Gulf Coast High School and went on with a scholarship to Florida Gulf Coast University to pursue a bachelors degree in Biology. At this stage in his life, Scar started shifting his likes in music, his passion for looking for new sounds grew. He started listening to electronic music, mainly: DJTiesto, ATB, Armin Van Buuren, Deadmau5, Afrojack, and ultimately Skrillex. As well as a mix of music with electronic influences: Bajofondo Tango Club, Gotan Project, Buraka Som Sistema, among others.

At the age of 19 he became illusioned with the idea of buying a turntable and starting a vinyl collection due to the importance of music in his life, at the same period in time he had already developed a passion for poetry, lyrics, and songwriting, and through friends in HighSchool had learned the use of beatmaking equipment. Then the break came, Scar found himself listening to one of the most substantial works of his life. 1977 by Ana Tijoux. To him the album proved that depth and unique sounds were possible.

In this new air, Scar went through friends telling them he wanted to make music and was introduced to TDavis and DJChase, two local artists who saw the musical potential that Scar brought.

Scar quickly adapted himself to the group by working with local independant record label ROKHouse Records, where he learned how to transform his abstract concepts into physical works, and within three months of doing Production work, mixing and mastering. He announced his desire to pursue a mixtape of Spanish Hip-hop and ROKHouse Records approved the work.

DJChase mentored his work, and became the major producer involved with the creation of the Urban Dreams : Sueños Urbanos mixtape. The mixtape was finished, and ROKHouse Records and Scar quickly started looking for ways to expand the music scene in his city and ways to expand his growth and image, and found breaks through the likes of Blacklight Propaganda and Ricardo Mantilla (RM).

The Mixtape Urban Dreams : Sueños Urbanos is to be released September 21st and it is the first of it's kind to come out of Naples Florida.

Scar still looks to expand his name and take his music to the next level. Multiple projects to be announced.</p>
